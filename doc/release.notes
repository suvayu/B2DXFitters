! 2013-02-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - some more cleanups in RooEffResModel, RooBinnedPdf 

! 2012-11-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitter-cFit.py: adapt to new classes (DecRateCoeff,
   NonOscTaggingPdf, MistagCalibration), some cleanups

! 2012-11-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - NonOscTaggingPdf: fix gcc4.6 compile error

! 2012-11-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - DecRateCoeff, NonOscTaggingPdf: relax the constraints imposed by the
   constructors somewhat

! 2012-11-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - NonOscTaggingPdf: correct description of untagged events in the same way as
   was done in DecRateCoeff

! 2012-11-19 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - DecRateCoeff: fix a couple of uninitialised pointers

! 2012-11-14 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - new class DecRateCoeff to replace DecayRateCoeff: proper treatment of
   coefficients in decay rate equations for oscillating decays - makes things
   quite a bit faster, and can handle various asymmetries (DecayRateCoeff had
   a few deficiencies)
 - PowLawAcceptance: fix includes
 - new class FinalStateChargePdf: finals state charge distribution with
   detection asymmetry
 - RooBinned1DQuinticBase: histogram can now either represent function value
   in bin middle or function integral over bin
 - MistagCalibration: implement the "proper" way to calibrate in addition to
   the present functionality, provide analytical integrals
 - RooBinned2DBicubicBase: technical fix for OS/X compatibility
 - standalone build system has doxygen config file, type "make doxy" to
   generate
 - changes in dictionaries to go with above points

! 2012-10-12 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - standalone/readTree/Makefile: slight tweak to improve time needed in
   parallel builds

! 2012-10-12 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - RooEffResModel: fix experimental code to actually work - it's a bit faster
   and uses a lot less memory, but the experimental code stays disabled for
   now until it's better tested...

! 2012-10-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - src/MassFitUtils.cxx: fix incorrect usage of std::fabs (and use std::abs
   which is clearer anyway)
 - standalone/Makefile: make better use of parallelism in multi-core builds by
   builing the dictionary first (so the longest job blocks a core from the
   beginning of the build job on while the other source files are built on the
   other CPUs instead of keeping this job until the end when all other files
   have been build already)

! 2012-10-10 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - DecayRateCoeff: some cleanup work
 - NonOscTaggingPdf: implement analytical integrals

! 2012-10-10 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - DecayRateCoeff: add a few comments to clarify

! 2012-10-10 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - add DecayRateCoeff class which calculates the coefficients to go into the
   decay rate equations in front of cosh, sinh, cos, sin as a function of CP
   parameters, tagging efficiency, mistag, and (production, tagging
   efficiency, mistag) asymmetries; this class gives the same results as the
   old expressions when the asymmetries are put to zero, and it provides
   analytical integrals over all potential observables

! 2012-10-10 - Suvayu Ali
 - Add acceptance fit and plotting scripts
 - readTree: used to create ntuple for acceptance fit

! 2012-10-09 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - put in symlinks to accomodate Agnieszka's split of GeneralUtils in the
   standalone build system

! 2012-10-09 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - Fix last few warnings

! 2012-10-08 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - Split GeneralUtils into three files:
   . GeneralUtils:
     . saveDataTemplateToFile, ReadPIDHist,  AddHist,  ReadOneName, ReadTreeData, ReadTreeMC
       ReadOneMode, ReadMode, TreeCut, SaveTemplate, SaveTemplateHist, SaveDataSet, CreatePDFMC

       ObtainSignal, CreatePdfSpecBackground, ExpectedYield, Blabla
   . SFitUtiles:
     . ReadDataFromSWeights, ReadDataFromSWeightsToys, CopyDataForToys  

! 2012-10-08 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - Modify scripts GenerateToySWeights_Ds{Pi,K}.py
   . add options
   . add confing files

! 2012-10-05 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - clean up mass and sFit fitters
 - add to all functions in GeneralUtils and Bs2Dsh2011TDAnaModels 
   bool variable "debug" as the last argument (especially for Vava ;-)) which suppress all couts
 - deal with annoying WARNING in sPlot creation (finally suppressed!)
 - add config files for mass fits
 - remove .txt Vava's files with configuration time fit   
 - change mass fit: now all scripts using confing python files
 - delate some options in scirpts (sorry if somebody (Vava?) is surprised)
 - change read sweights: 
   now for both MC and data are loaded directly from path (--pathName) with tree (--treeName)
 - add some new functions to GeneralUtils       
 - move .csh script to scripts/Csh
 
! 2012-10-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - adapt fitting/plotting scripts for cFit to changes committed today
 - rearrange PDF somewhat to save about a factor of 3 in RAM

! 2012-10-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - RooEffResModel: re-import from upstream, apply some experimental changes,
   which are disabled for now

! 2012-10-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - CPObservable: steamline code, size of object

! 2012-10-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix persistency problem in SharedArray

! 2012-10-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - MistagCalibration: add additional constructor to allow the use of
   unmodified calibration parameters (p_0, p_1, average mistag)

!============================== v1r5 03-10-2012 ==============================
! 2012-10-03 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - Package tagged as v1r5 to reflect all code related to the CONF note
   LHCb-CONF-2012-029 produced for CKM 2012

! 2012-10-02 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - update GeneralUtils (ReadDataFromsWeights, ObtainSignal)  
 - add script for plotting time with contributions

! 2012-09-20 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix bug in analytical integral of MistagDistribution (toy mock-distribution
   of per event mistag); spotted by Chiara Farinelli - thanks!

! 2012-09-15 - Agnieszka Dziurda 
 - modify sFit for signal MC  

! 2012-09-15 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - update plotting scripts for mass model

! 2012-09-14 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: fix bug in PDF (S/Sbar swap, multiply with -1)
 - cFit: add bug-for-bug compatibility flags
 - cFit: add possibility to interpolate acceptance correction
 - cFit: add possibility to fit directly for |lambda|, gamma+phi_s, delta
 - cFit: add possibility to constrain C^2+S^2+D^2=1 (similar for "bar")
 - SharedArray: small technical fix
 - RooBinned{1DQuinticBase,2DBicubicBase}: small technical fix

! 2012-09-13 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - CPObservable: fix bug in formulae, now in line with LHCb-INT-2011-051

! 2012-09-12 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - update BsDsPi time sFit scripts 

! 2012-09-12 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - NonOscTaggingPdf: remove analytical integral which was disabled because it
   did not work properly - in retrospect, it's clear why: integrating over a
   category variable means summing over category states, something which
   RooFit knows how to do quickly and efficiently ;)

! 2012-09-12 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: some cleanups, unblinded settings

! 2012-09-12 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: after extensive bug search, it turned out that real real data was
   missing a conversion between different units in the decay time; use
   the opportunity to robustify a few other bits

! 2012-09-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - prepare cFit for data: adjust parameters, implement tagging calibration

! 2012-09-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - NonOscTaggingPdf: should derive from RooAbsPdf, not RooAbsReal

! 2012-09-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - make_histos.py: Auto-exclude toy results based on fit quality flags stored
   in RooFitResult

! 2012-09-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: protect against typos in config dictionary files/command line

! 2012-09-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: description of Lambda_b/combinatorial BG completely screwed up, fix
   by putting in correct descriptions

! 2012-09-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: fix bug in yield adjustment procedure: Vava's toys include only on of
   the six data subsamples, so the (up,down)x(kkpi,kpipi,pipipi)-mixture needs
   to be adjusted accordingly

! 2012-09-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit changes:
   - routine to read in datasets from official tuple production/Vava's tuples
     this is based on reading the corresponding workspaces, and takes care of
     converting the variables that should have been categories to real
     categories
   - implement "shut up Minuit"-style blinding - this stays on as long as the
     referees say so, even for toys (it's ignored for toys)
   - make the fit crash before it does anything if people accidentally read
     real data in the toy configuration or vice-versa (thankfully, variable
     names in the dataset are slightly different)
   - during the fitting stage, adjust yields automatically to data set which
     was read in or generated
   - several small cleanups

! 2012-09-10 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - BdPTAcceptance: provide analytical time integral - while time is not the
   issue when integrating the acceptance function, numerical accuracy is, and
   here the analytical formula beats any numerical integrator...
 - cFit: clean up a little, make Optimize/Strategy settings part of the fit
   configuration

! 2012-09-09 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - added two new classes to interpolate smoothly between a given set of
   values in 1D and 2D, emphasis is on derivatives being well behaved
   (interpolation agrees with histogram values at bin centers, first and
   second derivatives in these points are continuous and differentiable);
   names are RooBinned1DQuinticBase and RooBinned2DBicubicBase

   these are templated classes, enabling one to get either a RooAbsPdf or a
   RooAbsReal derived class, depending on the template parameter specified

   these interpolation classes provide analytical integrals, and require a the
   histograms on which they are based to have uniform bin sizes

   the 1D version is not the final word on the issue, but is good enough for
   now...

 - helper class for interpolation classes: SharedArray, a copy-on-write array
   implementation (lots of interpolation coefficients, and RooFit loves
   cloning, so we better make sure we only have to clone a pointer ;)
 
 - make it possible for the cFit to use this interpolation as an option
 
 - cFit: work around yet another ownership issue between ROOT, Python and
   FitMeTool

! 2012-09-08 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: StaticAcceptance config option did not work as intended, fix

! 2012-09-08 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix issue in cFit where some data structures were released too early,
   causing a crash in FitMeTool

! 2012-09-08 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - adapt kfactorTDPartRecoBkgBs2DsK.py to run in standalone mode, put output
   into data/workspace
 - put the resulting k-factor distribution workspace into svn
 - make cFit use files in data/workspace
 - update cFit mass fitter constants to latest values

! 2012-09-06 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - FitMeTool: add possibility to add conditional observables and external
   constraints to the fit (with objects properly imported into workspace)
 - RooBinnedPdf, RooEffResModel: update from Gerhard Raven's repository
   upstream, with some changes to RooEffResModel to ensure that there are no
   memory leaks (probably not a problem in the first place, but hey, it was
   easy to make relatively airtight... ;)
 - RooGeneralisedSmearingBase: implement maximum value determination if
   underlying pdf and model support it (helps during generation,
   unfortunately not in our particular case - the pdf and mode we use do not
   support it)
 - RooGeneralisedSmearingBase: fix bug: when cloning an instance of
   RooGeneralisedSmearingBase and the original binning goes out of scope
   before the clone does, the clone has a dangling pointer; solution is to
   require the binning to be registered with the variable which is being
   binned, and then keeping a copy of the binning name within
   RooGeneralisedSmearingBase
 - cFit improvements:
   - fix several memory leaks on the python side of things
   - write and enable config dictionary sanitation and consistency checks
   - enable fitting with per-event mistag with the mistag being a purely
     conditional variable, i.e. without making the mistag distribution part of
     the pdf in the fit
   - only parametrise integrals of mistag/per event decay time when the
     conditional part of the pdf actually depends on it - this allows to
     generate with a per-event mistag distribution while the true mistag is
     something else entirely
   - fix setParameterizeIntegral usage for conditional PDFs; this brings
     conditional PDFs on par with neglecting the PDF and just specifying
     conditional observables; more importantly, is also fixes a crash when
     using conditional observables
   - have to revert to Optimize(0), or things will not converge properly -
     costs about a factor two in speed, but well worth it... ;)

! 2012-09-06 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix automatic dependency tracking in standalone build system for Reflex
   dictionaries (make could miss occasions when the dictionaries need to be
   remade)

! 2012-09-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix most compiler warnings in C++ code (no changes in behaviour)
   (there are still lots of warnings in GeneralUtils.cxx, mostly about
   potentially uninitialised variables, please check)
 - get rid of confusing pow(10,3)-style calls when we have perfectly
   acceptable 1e3 around

! 2012-09-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix a bug in the standalone setup.sh script for use with bash

! 2012-09-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - standalone builds are possible now; here's how:
   
   1. cd to the standalone subdirectory
   2. source setup.sh in that directory
   3. type "make distclean; make" in standalone
   4. run your favourite python scripts

   Some scripts may require a little modification, since GaudiPython is
   unavailable, see runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitter-cFit.py on how to do it
 - various cleanups throughout the code to make things work with newer
   compilers, no user-visible changes for what we use in the LHCb software
   stack, no changes in behaviour
 - cFit changes:
   - work in standalone setting
   - debug the long-standing bug with per-event mistags
   - keep variables common across modes where possible (e.g. if two modes have
     the same mistag, make sure they get the same RooFit Dilution object) to
     save some time in propagating value changes
   - some more k-factor integration tuning (although I suspect it's not final
     yet)
   - add possibility to switch between experimental mistag distribution and my
     MistagDistribution mock class for debugging purposes
   - autotune mistag binning for experimental mistag distributions
 - RooGeneralisedSmearingBase: remove unneeded member

! 2012-09-01 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - mass fit: add script dsdsstpirho.py and file conf_dsdsstpirho.txt
 
! 2012-08-30 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - mass fit: new result in data/workspace for BsDsK
 - mass fit: change DsDsstPiRho fractions in BsDsK mass fit

! 2012-08-29 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - mass fit: add data/workspace repository with mass fit workspace before and after fit. 
 - mass fit: change BdRho yield to be 1/3.5 of BdDPi 

! 2012-08-28 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - mass fit: fix tiny bug in BsDsK, Down, KPiPi plotting

! 2012-08-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit k-factor handling: fix pathology for 1 entry k-factor distributions

! 2012-08-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: fix a tiny issue in k-factor: for Bs -> Ds*K* we don't have a
   k-factor distribution, but we have practically no events either, so fit and
   generate them without k-factor

! 2012-08-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: possibility to combine CP observables and tagging efficiencies for
   DsK-like modes to effective CP observables and tagging efficiency during
   fit
 - cFit: take per-event mistag distribution from template (doesn't quite work
   yet)
 - cFit: some more integrator tuning

! 2012-08-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - work on runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC, runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitter-cFit:
   - figure out "correct" acceptance binning to avoid biases: 100 bins, adapt
     binning to turnon point of acceptance function
   - cFit: yield dump in log file (signal region)
   - cFit: allow to scale yields by given factor (10 x stats. and similar
     studies)
   - ToyMC: allow to fit |lambda|, weak, strong phase directly instead of
     using C, D, S, Dbar, Sbar
   - ToyMC: experimental: different way to normalise PDF - not equivalent to
     standard PDF, don't use for anything but research for now

! 2012-08-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC, runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitter-cFit:
   - update to include changes to calling conventions in last few commits
   - seems we can run at Optimize(1) after all 
   - retune integrator settings
   - take advantage of RooEffResModel, binned cache evaluation in k-factor
     smearing
   - order dataset before fit by categories to avoid cache poisoning; this
     gives cached values in RooFit Pdfs a better chance to be reused because
     input arguments to pdfs change less frequently
   - cFit only: move to triple gaussian resolution model

! 2012-08-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - RooGeneralisedSmearingBase:
   - fix bad bug in binned cache evaluation (did not always see when a
     variable changed)
   - add possibility to give a set of categories, so the binned cache isn't
     poisoned if one of the categories changes value (but that mean keeping a
     cache for each category value)
   - allow the cache to be used for "analytical" integration

! 2012-08-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - RooEffHistProd, RooEffResModel: fix various small memory leaks

! 2012-08-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - FitMeTool: in destructor, delete workspace to avoid memory leaks
   - consequence: if you want to use any objects that you got from FitMeTool
     (which are all owned by the workspace), you either have to make sure that
     you don't delete the instance of FitMeTool which owns the object, or your
     have to Clone() that object to get your private version

! 2012-08-24 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - update cFit script:
   - take advantage of new classes/improvements
   - get rid of unneccessary mass acceptance
   - fix a few bugs
   - new integrator settings
 - update dictionary files

! 2012-08-24 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - update to versions from upstream: RooEffHistProd, RooBinnedPdf
 - pull new class from G. Raven: RooEffResModel

! 2012-08-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - new class RooGeneralisedSmearingBase:
   - based on RooGeneralisedSmearing, replaces it and RooNumGenSmearPdf
   - implement optional binned caching & interpolation of smearing results integrals
     one variable to allow substatially faster evaluation of k-factor integrals;
     cache is filled lazily so low statistics data samples can benefit from not
     having to pre-calculate bins which are not going to be used

! 2012-08-23 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - update plots scripts
 - update combinatorial bakcground slopes

! 2012-08-09 - V. Gligorov
 - Update PropertimeResolutionModels to take a bias on the propertime as a 
   paramter
 - Update sFit scripts to be configured even more fully from the configuration
   files in the data directory
 - Update these configuration files to inherit from the nominal configuration
 - Make many new configuration files for the systematics  

! 2012-08-08 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: further stabilise fit (and improve fitting time) by parametrising the
   DsK-like backgrounds in terms of |lambda|, strong and weak phase instead of
   C,D,S,Dbar,Sbar and putting constraints

! 2012-08-08 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit: fix bug in binned acceptance handling, speed up constraints for
   DsK-like modes

! 2012-08-07 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - change expected yields in mass fitter

! 2012-08-06 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - changes for tag omega pdf distributions -> GeneralUtils.cxx

! 2012-08-06 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - cFit changes
   * fit for tagging efficiencies (signal, DsK-like per channel, DsPi-like
     separate for decaying Bs and Bd, Lb, comb. BG)
   * do not float Delta m_s (gives biases on CP parameters if I float it)
   * better description of Lb BG in time
 - old fitting scripts (runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC): allow to constrain
   C from magnitude of lambda 

! 2012-08-04 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - fix bug in PID histos 
 - changes in all plotting scripts (time and mass)
 - small changes in run Bs->DsK time script -> add workspace
 - add scripts to fit Bd->DPi from data
 - changes in data/config.. files for DsK and DsPi
 
! 2012-08-02 - V. Gligorov
 - Change the PropertimeResolutionModels.cxx code to return a single Gaussian
   model which can be used outside the FitMeTool framework as well as inside
   it when asked to do so. This change effectively makes the returning of the
   single and triple Gaussian models consistent.
 - Make the type of resolution model a command line option. 
 - Major rewrite of the sFit time fitting scripts. All parameter configuration
   is now done via python dictionaries placed in the "/data" directory of this
   package. The fitters for DsPi and DsK then take the name of the configuration
   file to run with from which the options are read. 
 - Three configurations have been added so far 
   . Bs2DsPiConfigForNominalDMSFit
   . Bs2DsPiConfigForDMSFitWithFloatingTAcc
   . Bs2DsKConfigForNominalGammaFit
   Their names should be pretty self explanatory.
 - Make the time fitting scripts print all their configuration options to the
   logfile now.

! 2012-08-01 - V. Gligorov
 - Change blinding to be done by forcing Minuit to be quiet. In blinded mode
   the sFitters now print only the parameter uncertainties.
 - Update triple Gaussian resolution model code so it can be used in the fits.
 - Many other small updates on the sFit side to the fitting interface. Can
   now choose to use fitMeTool or not on the command line.  

! 2012-08-01 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - add RangeAcceptance class: function to return 1 if some variable is within
   a range of min, max
 - enforce a mass RangeAcceptance in cFit to get rid of biases

! 2012-07-31 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - scripts/make_histos.py: fix a bug in the pull calculation for histogram
   bounds autocalculation
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitter-cFit.py: tune integrator settings a tiny little
   bit

! 2012-07-30 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitter-cFit.py:
   * clean up the code and modularise
   * put in the combinatorial BG used by our cFit colleagues
   * put in the machinery for blinding C, D, Dbar, S, Sbar, for the Bs->DsK
     and Delta m_s which shared by all B_s decays (some more logic is needed
     to activate this automatically when reading data tuples)

! 2012-07-29 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fork runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: cFit will continue to be developed
   in runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitter-cFit.py which contains these improvements
   * include all backgrounds (although for some the parameterisation may not
     be final yet)
   * update acceptance parameters to what Vava reports from fit to DsPi
   * changes needed to accomodate the additional CP parameters for the
     DsK-like backgrounds, including constraining the sum of squares of the CP
     parameters
   * fine-tune k-factor integration range from mode/template width
   * fine-tune k-factor integration settings (still complains about not being
     able to reach target precision, but I'd guess that's due to the templates
     looking strange to the integrator)
   * use binned acceptance function by default, otherwise it's unbearably slow
     (per event mistag does not work at the moment, runs out of memory)

! 2012-07-29 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix a few minor issues with TagEfficiencyWeightNoCat.cxx, generate
   dictionaries for it

! 2012-07-29 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - python/B2DXFitters/cpobservables.py: when printing CP observables,
   optionally print which mode they're for

 - FitMeTool: allow to pass more RooCmdArgs when fitting/generating; this
   change is backwards-compatible with existing code

 - GeneralUtils.cxx: in k-factor extraction, constrain missing daughter from
   K* to pion mass, in Ds* case, autodetect photon/pion and constrain
   accordingly

! 2012-07-28 - V. Gligorov 
 - Lots of commits all over the place for sFit and similar. Some highlights
   of what was added/changed
   . DrawPullsFor* are scripts to scan logfiles and produce pull plots for 
     toy studies
   . runBsDsK_sFit_* are scripts to run toys on a large scale
   . Changes to toy generators to generate with correct Lb and combo lifetimes
   . Add upper time cut of 10ps and upper mistag cut of 0.48 for the toys
   . TagEfficiencyWeightNoCat.cxx class to compute tag efficiency weight
     without use of categories

! 2012-07-28 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: finish routine to extract pdfs and
   yields from mass fitter workspace; the new routine will automatically
   correct for different mass ranges considered in mass fit and cFit

! 2012-07-28 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: routine to read in k-factor
   distributions; reading in yields from mass fitter will need some more workspace
   and will be fixed in a future commit

! 2012-07-28 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - merge plot_histos and make_histos scripts, figure out ranges and plot all
   plottable variables automatically in a 3 * RMS range around the central
   value of the variable (gets rid of strange binning effect in
   pulls/residuals)

! 2012-07-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: first shot at reading mass pdfs or
   templates from result of mass fit (not used so far)

! 2012-07-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - some improvements to {make,plot}_histos.py scripts
 - in runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: go back to the somewhat safer
   integrator settings

! 2012-07-27 Suvayu Ali

 - fix small bug for option --tagOmegaPdf in GeneralUtils.cxx 

! 2012-07-25 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix bug in IfThreeWay and IfThreeWayPdf classes: when truncating the
   condition to an integer, imprecisely rounded float values in the input
   could screw up the intended result. Fix is to explicitly convert to double,
   with an area from -epsilon to epsilon reserved to represent the zero where
   epsilon is tuned to the floating point accuracy of the float data type
   which is used to store the data in our tuples

 - add lab1_PT to observables for --tagTool option
 
! 2012-07-24 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - update runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: make acceptance parameters
   tunable via configuration dictionary

! 2012-07-23 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - make DecayTreeTupleSucksFitter fail if it converges to unphysical values
   when constraining particles to a completely wrong mass

! 2012-07-22 - Suvayu Ali 
 - K-factor distributions for partially reconstructed backgrounds.
   Also account for wrong mass hypothesis for mis-id'd bachelor.

   convergence also under difficult conditions

! 2012-07-20 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - fix minor bug in GenerateToySWeights_DsX.py X={K,Pi}

! 2012-07-20 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - polish DecayTreeTupleSucksFitter somewhat so it can constrain zero mass
   particles

! 2012-07-20 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - change mass constraint method in DecayTreeTupleSucksFitter from a
   constraint on the mass to a constraint on the mass squared; this method
   behaves somewhat nicer in corner cases because the problem spot in sqrt(x)
   around x = 0 is not there; there should not be any user visible change in
   behaviour or results

! 2012-07-19 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - extend DecayTreeTupleSucksFitter to allow constraining the mass of the
   intermediate resonance of which we lose one daughter (e.g. in
   D_s*->D_s gamma, allow to also constrain the D_s* mass)

! 2012-07-18 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - add DecayTreeTupleSucksFitter class: refit (MC truth) momenta read from
   DecayTreeTuple because the floating point precision used to save 4-momenta
   is insufficient for k-factor extraction in some modes (refit here means a
   fit with mass constraints and imposed 4-momentum conservation)

! 2012-07-16 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix bad bug in runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py which caused the updates
   to fit and generation configuration dictionary go to the same underlying
   object - fix by explicitly making 2 copies of the default config dictionary

! 2012-07-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: Implement a sustainable configuration
   management solution for toys: All fit/generator configuration options and
   settings are saved in a dictionary; a default dictionary is contained in
   the source code, and both fit and generator configuration are based on it.
   Command line options allow to read in an expression like '{"NSigEvts":20}'
   which update the fit or generator configuration. These expressions can be
   read in from a file, or they can be given at the command line. If both are
   supplied, the expression given on the command line overrides what is given
   in the file for those dictionary entries which occur in both.

   (Hint: feel free to steal the mechanism, even if the variables in your
   configuration are called differently - running different scenarios will
   become much easier... ;)

! 2012-07-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py: fix python/workspace ownership issues
   once and for all by introducing the WS(ws, obj) routine which makes the
   workspace ws "swallow" the object and returns a pointer to the swallowed
   object; thus, constructor calls now can be written as:
   var = WS(ws, RooConstVar('var', 'variable', 42.0))

! 2012-07-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - changes to runBs2DsKCPAsymmObsFitterToyMC.py
   * first "k-factor ready" version
   * split running the toy and preparing the pdf (allows for different pdfs in
     generation and fitting (to test effect of simplifications like per event
     errors vs. average errors)

! 2012-07-10 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - change CombBkgPTPdf to provide analytical integrals over time to speed
   things up a bit (easy to do and does not hurt)

! 2012-07-10 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - change cmt/requirements to put debugging symbols in - we still optimize the
   code, but like this, a crash dump will contain a line number, making things
   a bit easier

! 2012-07-10 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - Implement the speedup in k-factor smearing discussed in last Wednesday's
   time-dependent B2OC meeting: we exploit analytical integrals the physics
   pdf may provide to avoid a 2D integration over time and k-factor, thus
   arriving at an "analytical" integral over k-factor distribution times
   analytical time integral over physics pdf; the integration over k is still
   done numerically, despite what the name says... This gives a speedup of
   several orders of magnitude.

! 2012-07-08 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix dictionary for k-factor smearing classes: correctly specify transient
   class members (ROOT dictionaries use the "//!" comment whereas you need
   to put a special xml tag into the xml for genreflex...

! 2012-07-06 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - add classes needed for the k-factor smearing integral:
   RooGeneralisedSmearing RooGenSmearIntegrandBinding RooNumGenSmearPdf

! 2012-07-06 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - toys update:
   . in scripts "run" (time and mass model) add new option - toys (yes/no)
   . add new functions to GeneralUtils.{cxx,h}
   . modify "Generate" scripts  
  
! 2012-07-05 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix src/GeneralModels.cxx which got polluted with some local debugging
   changes by reverting it to the previous version. I'm terribly sorry for the
   inconvenience

! 2012-07-05 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix scripts/plotBs2DSHTimeModels.py so that it works well with the changes
   in the fitter code; also move to ROOT batch mode, so one can do the
   plotting in a screen where the X connection may be lost

! 2012-07-02 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - added class which mimics shape of typical mistag distribution on data
   (careful, the average mistag of the distribution cannot be tuned between
   arbirary limits for all sets of parameters, so read documentation, test
   and plot the pdf before you fit)
 - imported two classes (RooBinnedPdf, RooEffHistProd) from G. Raven's (et
   al.) p2vv fitter repository; these two classes allow to bin the acceptance
   function from any given distribution, thus allowing to speed up the fitter
   (anything that doesn't work as advertised was probably broken by me during
   the import)
 - speed up the toy fitter by moving from decayPath to two separate categories
   (gains about a factor 2-3)
 - restructure the code of the toy fitter to allow for per-event mistag (for
   now Bs->DsK and Bs->DsPi), and also per-event decay time errors
 - build a new (python) procedure to return a time pdf for all of these options,
   include (dummy) parameters which will allow the inclusion of the k-factor
   approach for the backgrounds in the future cFit
 - edit scripts/{make,plot}_histos.py to get rid of the ROOT crash

! 2012-07-01 - Agnieszka Dziurda
 - Clean up campaign

   - added two scripts: GenerateToySWeights_DsPi.py and GenerateToySWeights_DsK.py (wrote by Vava&myself)   
   - we needed RooKeysPdf for TagOmega, because of that:
     . added new bool argument in GeneralUtils function: 
   CreatePDFMC, ObtainMissForBsDsK, ObtainMissForBsDsPi, ObtainSpecBack  
       and changed prepareBsDsPiMassFitterOnData.py, prepareBsDsKMassFitterOnData.py
   - added to GeneralUtils function: generateFlavProd

! 2012-06-24 - Manuel Tobias Schiller

   though)
 - per event proper time errors are disabled for now (appears to be a bug in
   RooFit; apparently it generates the acceptance and not the full PDF)

   the same thing, I refactored a bit such that they all share the same code
   to avoid duplication
